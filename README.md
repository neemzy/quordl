# QUORDL

Quordle clone powered by React & Tailwind

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

For now, answers have to be manually set in `src/index.js` (make sure they are five letters long), and there is no support for a dictionary of allowed words.

## Usage

```
$ npm start     # Run on localhost:3000
$ npm run build # Build for production
```
