# QUORDL

Quordle clone powered by React & Tailwind

## Setup

```
$ npm install
```

For now, the app uses a fixed (French) dictionary of words, and it doesn't discriminate guesses outside of this dictionary.

## Usage

```
$ npm start     # Run on localhost:3000
$ npm run build # Build for production
```
